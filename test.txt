OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Python’s standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. os.path module is sub-module of OS module in Python used for common pathname manipulation.
os.path.join() method in Python join one or more path components intelligently. This method concatenates various path components with exactly one directory separator (‘/’) following each non-empty part except the last path component. If the last path component to be joined is empty then a directory separator (‘/’) is put at the end. 
If a path component represents an absolute path, then all previous components joined are discarded and joining continues from the absolute path component.
